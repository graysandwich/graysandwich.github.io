        <p>One of my old hobbies was speedtyping.</p>
        In grade 6, my teacher forced us to go on the computer and learn to type. We did this almost every day.
        <p>During grade 7, we also did this, but I found a new website named Monkeytype, where we could test our typing speed. My and my friend would contantly race to see who was faster. My record at that time was around 70 wpm (words per minute).</p>
        <p>During grade 8 and 9, I continued to do this on and off, and eventually, I got my current personal best of 159 wpm, which was a huge jump from the previous 145 wpm.</p>
        <p>Learning to type quickly is useful for school projects where I have to write an essay. My handwriting is extremely messy, so being able to type quickly is useful for this.</p>
