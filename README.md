This is my cs50 project. It is a personal webpage using Jekyll and Github Pages. In this website, I can post blogs about my life and other things I find interesting. Currently, This website has four pages: my old website, computer science, school, and typing. My old website has the website that I used for the cs50 homepage assignment. The computer science website had information about computer science and talked about why I liked it so much. The school website talked about the classes I am in and about my experience in school. Finally, the typing website talks about one of my old hobbies, which was speed typing.
